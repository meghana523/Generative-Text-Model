*Over View*:

*A Generative Text Model is a type of natural language processing (NLP) system that creates human-like text based on input prompts. These models learn the structure, grammar, and meaning of language from large datasets and then use this knowledge to generate new, coherent, and contextually relevant text.*

*At its core, a generative model is trained to predict the next word (or token) in a sentence given the previous words. For example, if given the input “The sky is”, the model might generate “blue” as the next word. Over time and with enough data, these models learn to produce entire paragraphs, summaries, stories, or even code.*

*One of the major strengths of these models is their ability to produce fluent and context-aware responses. However, they also come with challenges, such as generating incorrect or biased outputs if not carefully trained or monitored.*

*In summary, generative text models play a vital role in AI-driven language understanding and generation, making them powerful tools in both academic research and real-world applications.*
